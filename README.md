# Tom and Jerry Path Planning

## Overview

This project implements a variation of the A* algorithm for path planning in a grid-based environment. The A* algorithm is a popular choice for finding the shortest path between two points in a graph, taking into account both the cost to reach each node and a heuristic that estimates the cost to reach the goal from that node.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: heapq (for priority queue), math (for mathematical operations)
